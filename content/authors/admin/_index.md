Hello! My name is Ankush and I am currently studying computer science (with a minor 
in data science) at Caltech.

Some of my interests within the field include deep learning applications, GPU programming, distributed computing, and numerical computing. I have work experience at Cadence Design Systems, The College of William and Mary,
and NASA Langley Research Center.

Languages I know well are Python, C/C++, MATLAB, SQL, Verilog, and Scala. Some 
frameworks/tools I am very experienced with are Tensorflow/Pytorch/Keras, CUDA, Apache Spark, and Linux.

Fun facts:

*  I can solve the Rubik's Cube in 9 seconds and was once ranked #1 in Virginia
*  My favorite NBA team is the San Antonio Spurs and my favorite soccer team is Werder Bremen
*  I have been to 16 concerts and counting :smile: (some of my favorite are Post Malone, Coldplay, and Linkin Park)
